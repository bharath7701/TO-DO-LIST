### Summary

The application consists of:
1. **HTML**: Structuring the webpage with input elements (textarea and buttons) for adding tasks and a container to display the task list.
2. **CSS**: Styling the application for a clean, modern look with gradient backgrounds, custom buttons, and a responsive layout.
3. **JavaScript**: Handling the core functionality, such as adding tasks, marking them as completed, and removing them.

### Input

- **User Input**: The user inputs a task in the provided textarea and clicks the check button (✔️) to add the task to the list. The task will appear below in the to-do list.
- **Buttons**: 
  - **Check button**: Marks tasks as complete by adding a strikethrough effect.
  - **Trash button**: Deletes a task from the list.

### Output

- A list of tasks displayed dynamically below the input area.
- Completed tasks are crossed out.
- Tasks can be removed by clicking the trash button.

### Example Flow
